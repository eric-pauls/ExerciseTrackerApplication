To run application, run npm install in both the exercises-rest and exercises-ui folders. Next run npm start in each of these folders so start mongodb and react.

In this project I use the MERN stack to write a Single Page Application (SPA) that tracks exercises completed by the user. I used React for the front-end UI app. I also wrote a REST API using Node and Express for the back-end web service. MongoDB was used for persistence.

The application allows users to track exercise by name, weight, reps, weight unit, and date completed. Exercises can be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted.
